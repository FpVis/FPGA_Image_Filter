# FPGA Image Processing Projects on Basys-3

This repository contains various image processing projects using the **Basys-3 FPGA Development Board**. The projects make use of the **OV7670 camera module** to capture images, and several image processing techniques are implemented to manipulate and display the images on a connected VGA monitor.

## Overview
The goal of this repository is to provide an easy-to-follow guide and reusable code for building image processing systems on the Basys-3 FPGA board. The key components include:

- **Basys-3 FPGA** for hardware implementation
- **OV7670 Camera Module** for capturing images
- **VGA Monitor** for displaying processed images
- **Image Processing Algorithms** such as filtering, contrast adjustment, grayscale conversion, upscaling, and more.

## Projects

### 1. Chroma Key
### 2. Edge Detector
### 3. Stereo Depth Estimation
### 4. Various Filters
